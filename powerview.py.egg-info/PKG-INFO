# PowerView.py

## Disclaimer
This repository has nothing related to the existing [pywerview.py](https://github.com/the-useless-one/pywerview) project that is already publicly available. This is only meant for my personal learning purpose and would like to share the efforts with everyone interested. This project will be supported by the collaborators from time to time, so don't worry.

## What is PowerView.py?
PowerView.py is an alternative for the awesome original [PowerView.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) script. Most of the modules used in PowerView are available in this project ( some of the flags are changed ). There are also some major improvements to the features and functionality since we added ADCS enumeration features and some other great features_(more below)_.

We are not developers, bugs and errors are very likely to happen during execution. Please submit issue if you encounter any issues with the tool.

## Interesting Features
* Embeded user session
* Binding with multiple protocols (ldap, ldaps, gc, gc-ssl), trial and error approach. SSL connection is prioritized.
* Mini Powerview.py console to make you feel like home when using PowerView.ps1
* Auto-completer, so no more remembering commands
* Cross-Domain interactions (might or might not work)
* Check if current user has Domain Admin or adminCount attribute set to 1
* Table format feature mirroring the output style of PowerShell's `Format-Table`.
_Maybe more?_

## Why not just stick with the ps1 script?
1. Detections
As most of yall know, _PowerView.ps1_ is highly likely to get detected by Defender or AV vendors once downloaded onto the PC. An offensive tool to get detected by AV is a red flag during engagement. Maybe some of you thinking, why not just bypass AMSI and import the script undetected? Well, some of the big companies normally have EDR installed on most endpoints and EDRs are normally hook amsi patching and also most likely would get detected during AMSI patching. So, PowerView.py FTW!

2. Proxy with ease
Running LDAP query tools through proxies (i.e. SOCKS) is quite overwhelming since it requires a lot of stuffs needed to be installed (i.e. Proxyfier). I dont think windows can support proxychains just yet (at least not on top of my head). Since powerview.py is just a python tool, wrapping it with proxychains is definitely possible. Used it most of the time and it worked like a charm!

## Installation
#### Default
1. Install with pip
```
pip3 install .

# or remotely

pip3 install -e "https://github.com/aniqfakhrul/powerview.py"
```

### With Channel Binding Support
_Sign and seal and channel binding functionalities would require ldap3 installed from this [fork](https://github.com/ThePirateWhoSmellsOfSunflowers/ldap3@tls_cb_and_seal_for_ntlm) and [gssapi](https://pypi.org/project/gssapi/) library. But no worries, all are already implemented in setup.py. (Note: Addinional libkrb5-dev package need to be installed on the OS level)_

1. Install `libkrb5-dev` apt package
```
sudo apt install libkrb5-dev
```

2. Install with pip with additional dependencies
```
pip3 install .[sign_and_cb]
```

## Basic Usage
_Note that some of the kerberos functions are still not functioning well just yet but it still do most of the works. More information can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/aniqfakhrul/powerview.py/wiki) section_
* Init connection
```
powerview range.net/lowpriv:Password123@192.168.86.192 [--dc-ip 192.168.86.192] [-k] [--use-ldap | --use-ldaps]
```
* Init connection with specific authentication. Note that `--use-sign-and-seal` and `--use-channel-binding` is only available if you install `ldap3` library directly from this [branch](https://github.com/ThePirateWhoSmellsOfSunflowers/ldap3/tree/tls_cb_and_seal_for_ntlm) 
```
powerview range.net/lowpriv:Password123@192.168.86.192 [--use-channel-binding | --use-sign-and-seal | --use-simple-auth]
```

* Query for specific user
```
Get-DomainUser Administrator
Get-DomainUser -Identity Administrator
```

* Specify search attributes
```
Get-DomainUser -Properties samaccountname,description
```

* Filter results
```
Get-DomainUser -Where 'samaccountname [contains][in][eq] admins'
```

* Count results
```
Get-DomainUser -Count
```

* Output result to file
```
Get-DomainUser -OutFile ~/domain_user.txt
```

* Set module
```
Set-DomainObject -Identity "adminuser" -Set 'servicePrincipalname=http/web.ws.local'
Set-DomainObject -Identity "adminuser" -Append 'servicePrincipalname=http/web.ws.local'
Set-DomainObject -Identity "adminuser" -Clear 'servicePrincipalname'
```

* Relay mode
```
powerview 10.10.10.10 --relay [--use-ldap | --use-ldaps]
```

### Logging
We will never miss logging to keep track of the actions done. By default, powerview creates a `.powerview` folder in current user home directory _(~)_. Each log file is generated based on current date.
Example path: `/root/.powerview/logs/bionic.local/2024-02-13.log`

### To-Do
* ~~Add logging function to track and monitor what have been run.~~
* ~~Add cache functionality to minimize network interaction.~~
* Support more authentication flexibility.
    * ~~Channel Binding~~
    * ~~Sign and Seal~~
    * ~~Simple Authentication~~
    * Schannel. Authentication with pfx
